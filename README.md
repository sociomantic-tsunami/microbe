# Microbe

Microbe, or Âµ, is a javascript framework...

### Another JS framework, really... ?

Microbe is born from a trip in Hamburg where someone showed simple shortcuts everyday functions, such as querySelector or querySelectorAll.
So why not go further and make better and learn how this `<insert JS framework here>` magic works ?

It is being developed as both an ongoing learning experiment, as well as something to use internally once its speed has been tweaked. The goal being to write an efficent library in both ES5 and ES6 to be ready for the future. The ES6 version is already usable through [traceur-compiler](https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler) (included in our gulpfile).

Microbe, which is aiming to be somewhat general and expendable as wish, is separated into several categories:
- CSS helpers (add classes, change style, ... )
- Events helpers (bind DOM events, unbind, ... )
- HTML helpers, *aka a DOM manipulation that might be split even more in the future* (selectors, attributes, ... )
- HTTP helpers making use of Promises (get, post, ... )
- Generalistic helpers (iterator, each, ... )

And more to come. Don't hesitate to file an issue for features that you'd like to see.
